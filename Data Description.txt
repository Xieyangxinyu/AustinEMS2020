·       Problem states the problem type of the emergency.
·       Time_PhonePickUp_Date states the date of the EMS call.
·       Time_First_Unit_Assigned (in minutes) states the length of time, in minutes, after the EMS call was picked up and before the first ambulance received notification of the emergency and was as- signed.
·       Time_First_Unit_Enroute (in minutes) states the length of time, in minutes, after the first ambu- lance was assigned and before the ambulance set off toward the emergency.
·       Time_First_Unit_Arrived (in minutes) states the length of time, in minutes, after the first ambu- lance wheels began to roll and before the ambulance arrived at the emergency and the wheels stopped.
·       Call_Disposition states the final disposition of the event, such as cancelled call, transported to hospital, etc. If the ambulance transported the patient to a hospital, the name of the hospital would be specified. If the emergency call was from another government agency, for exam- ple, the Austin Fire Department, then the call dispo- sition would be labelled as ”referred”. Other types of call dispositions fall into the category of ”defunct calls”; in this case, the call disposition of an incident would be labelled as its respective subcategory.
·       Call_Disposition states the acuity of the emergency. A 1 indicates highest priority and a 15 would indicate least priority.
